version 1.2.4 2023-08-03  Carl Ulberg   <ulbergc@uw.edu>
    * Summary:
      - Add internal/external message versions in driveGFAST. The internal versions start at v-1,
        then decrement by 1 on every single iteration. The external version numbers start at v0,
        and increment by 1 on pgd xml messages that are actually sent to the Solution Aggregator.
        Every message is still saved in the run/out directory - if the message was sent to the SA,
        it will have the positive, external version number. If it was not sent, it will have the
        negative, internal version number.
      - Change how pgd xml timestamp is defined. Previously it represented the time at the start
        of the current iteration. Now it represents the time closest to when the message is
        actually sent (really from when the message is generated, but then it is sent in the next
        step).
      - Add publish change thresholds. Among the other send filter logic, the change thresholds
        ensure that GFAST won't send identical (or nearly identical) messages to the SA.
      - Refactor some code out of driveGFAST (easier to unit test), fillCoreEventInfo and
        sendXMLFilter
      - New unit tests
version 1.2.3 2023-04-10  Carl Ulberg    <ulbergc@uw.edu>
    * Summary:
      - Fully use Q channel with "goodness/use" flag. If configuration is set, GFAST will ignore
        data points and PGD observations with a use flag of 0, as determined by the CWU/Fastlane
        processing.
      - Use "sleep" instead of "while true" loop for each 1s iteration. Saves processor time,
        although may lead to slight creep in iteration start time.
version 1.2.2 2022-12-28  Carl Ulberg    <ulbergc@uw.edu>
    * Summary:
      - Bring Q channel through processing. Not entirely set up, but the Q channel is mostly
        available when calculating PGD, along with the 6 other channels: ENZ/ENZ uncertainty.
version 1.2.1 2022-11-28  Carl Ulberg    <ulbergc@uw.edu>
    * Summary:
      - Add hashmap to tb2 processing to speed up get/unpack messages.
      - Add raw observation uncertainty thresholds in PGD processing. This is intended to handle
        clock correction steps in the data.
version 1.2.0 2022-10-04  Carl Ulberg    <ulbergc@uw.edu>
    * Summary:
      - Add GFAST to ShakeAlert repo
      - Use DMMessageReceiver for reading AMQ messages.
      - Add GFAST to ShakeAlert unit test coverage report. 
      - Add config options for turning on/off pgd/cmt/ff processing. 
      - Reduce hdf5 archive size
